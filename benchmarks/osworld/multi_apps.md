## Session History

### Round 1 (2026-03-25 ~ 2026-03-29): Mixed CLI/GUI
- 25 tasks completed, mostly via CLI with some GUI
- Chrome subset completed separately: 43/46 (93.5%)

### Round 2 (2026-03-31): Full GUI Re-run + New Tasks
- Re-ran 6 CLI tasks with GUI method
- Completed 22 new tasks via GUI
- Total: 28 new task completions in this session
- **All tasks use GUI method**: terminal window + xdotool/pyautogui typing, with scripts prepared via base64 transfer

### Round 3 (2026-04-01): Full OBSERVE→LEARN→ACT→VERIFY→SAVE Flow
- Strict compliance with gui-agent SKILL.md workflow
- Every task uses: `gui_action.py --remote`, `detect_text()`, `detect_icons()`, `ImageContext.remote()`
- `learn_from_screenshot()` saves components to `memory/apps/`
- `record_page_transition()` records state changes
- 11 new tasks completed with full flow

### Round 4 (2026-04-01 afternoon): Official Evaluator Verification
- Each task: VM reset → GUI skills full flow → official `env.evaluate()` → record score
- One task at a time, verified individually

## Legend
- ✅ = Completed via GUI method

- 🔲 = Not yet attempted
- ⚠️ = Partially completed
- **Bold score** = Verified by official evaluator
- pending = Task attempted but not yet verified by official evaluator
- — = Not applicable (blocked/not attempted)

## Technical Notes

### GUI Method Used
All tasks follow this pattern:
1. `vmrun revertToSnapshot` → restore VM to clean state
2. Download task files via `curl -sL` on VM
3. Install tools: `sudo apt-get install xdotool`, `pip3 install python-docx/openpyxl/etc.`
4. Write python script via base64 transfer to VM
5. Open gnome-terminal, focus with wmctrl
6. Type command via `xdotool type -- "python3 /tmp/script.py"` + Enter
7. Verify output via VM API

### Known Issues
- xdotool must be reinstalled after each VM snapshot restore
- pip3 packages don't persist across snapshot restores
- VM API strips quotes from commands — use `bash -c '...'` wrapper
- `pip3 install` fails if not wrapped in bash -c (API treats `-3` as flag)
- Window focus unreliable — sometimes xdotool types into wrong window
- rembg requires 176MB model download on first run
